# Introduction

#### This tutorial is purely for fun, just making one.

# Preparation

- Termux
- Tabby Terminal

# Steps

1. Install openssh
   Open Termux and enter

```sh
pkg install openssh
```

Then enter `sshd` to enable SSH functionality.

2. Configure sshd
   Enter

```sh
ifconfig
```

to get the IP address.

::: tip Note
This tutorial is for internal network SSH connection, not public SSH, meaning both devices need to be on the same WiFi.
:::
After getting the IP, set the SSH connection password

```sh
passwd
```

Set the password.
::: tip Note
The SSHD service started on Termux uses port 8022, not the usual port 22.
:::
Then open Tabby, click Settings -> Configuration and Connection -> New -> New Configuration -> SSH Connection

Enter your IP + password.

After configuration, save the connection. The successful connection looks like this:
