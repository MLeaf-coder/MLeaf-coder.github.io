# Install BT Panel on Android Phone without Root

### Welcome to this tutorial on turning your Android phone into a server.

### Introduction

Many of us have old or unused phones lying around at home. Although these phones are often set aside, they still have many potential uses. This time, we'll try installing the BT Panel on an Android phone. Some might ask, isn't BT Panel used on servers? That's correct, but Android's underlying system is based on Linux, and we can access this layer through Termux. Termux is a Linux terminal emulator that runs on Android, allowing us to implement many server functions.

### Preparation

1. Android phone
2. Computer
3. Termux
4. SSH tool

All software used in this tutorial will be linked at the end of the article for download.

### Tutorial

1. Download [ZeroTermux](https://github.com/hanxinhao000/ZeroTermux), which is a secondary development based on Termux, more user-friendly for beginners.
2. Download and open ZeroTermux. After agreeing to the software terms, swipe right and click to switch sources. It's recommended to use the Tsinghua source. Wait for the installation to complete.
3. Swipe right again, click on container switch, and click the floating ball below to create a new container. It will prompt you to restart the software; agree to do so.
4. Reopen ZeroTermux. For easier operation, we'll use SSH to connect and operate from a computer.
5. In the ZeroTermux command line, enter:

```bash
apt install openssh
```

Install SSH. After installation, we need to set a password. Enter:

```bash
passwd
```

Enter the password twice when prompted. Note that password input is not displayed in the Linux console.
Open the SSH client on your computer. You can use [BT's SSH terminal tool](https://www.bt.cn/new/product_ssh.html) to connect. First, in ZeroTermux, enter:

```bash
ifconfig
```

We can see the current IP address. Open the SSH client on your computer and enter the corresponding IP.

Note for beginners: 127.0.0.1 is the localhost IP and cannot be accessed by other devices. So access the IP starting with 192 or any other IP you see.

Next, set a port. Ports below 1200 might not be available on Android, so set a large port that won't be occupied by other software.

```bash
sshd -p 3358
```

We've set port 3358 here, but you can choose a port you prefer. Then fill in the corresponding data in the SSH terminal tool on your computer to connect. Once the SSH terminal shows a successful connection, you can ignore the phone and operate on the computer.

6. Install Ubuntu system. This is a Linux system where we'll deploy the BT Panel. We'll use Guoguang's script for installation. First, install dependencies:

```bash
pkg install proot git python -y
```

Then download the script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sqlsec/termux-install-linux
cd termux-install-linux
python termux-linux-install.py
```

It should run without errors, and we'll see a window as shown in the image.
<img src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?resid=2182F48B953D36F8%2114555&authkey=%21AHGa9T-9MZ2Xm68&width=844&height=552" width="844" height="552" />

Enter 1 to install automatically. After installation, we should be in the Ubuntu system by default. If we enter 'ps', we might get an error due to partition mounting issues.
:::warning
Error: /proc must be mounted
To mount /proc at boot you need an /etc/fstab line like:
proc /proc proc defaults
In the meantime, run "mount proc /proc -t proc"
:::
To exit the Ubuntu system, enter:

```bash
exit
```

When you see ~$, it means you've successfully exited.

Next, we need to fake five files in the /proc partition: locdavg, stat, uptime, version, and vmstat.
Enter the following commands to create them:

```bash
cd /data/data/com.termux && touch locdavg stat uptime version vmstat
```

Fake the locdavg file:

```bash
echo '0.12 0.07 0.02 2/165 765' > ./locdavg
```

Fake the stat file:

```bash
echo -e 'cpu 1957 0 2877 93280 262 342 254 87 0 0\ncpu0 31 0 226 12027 82 10 4 9 0 0\ncpu1 45 0 664 11144 21 263 233 12 0 0\ncpu2 494 0 537 11283 27 10 3 8 0 0\ncpu3 359 0 234 11723 24 26 5 7 0 0\ncpu4 295 0 268 11772 10 12 2 12 0 0\ncpu5 270 0 251 11833 15 3 1 10 0 0\ncpu6 430 0 520 11386 30 8 1 12 0 0\ncpu7 30 0 172 12108 50 8 1 13 0 0\nintr 127541 38 290 0 0 0 0 4 0 1 0 0 25329 258 0 5777 277 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nctxt 14022\nbtime 1680020856\nprocesses 772\nprocs_running 2\nprocs_blocked 0\nsoftirq 75663 0 5903 6 25375 10774 0 243 11685 0 21677' > ./stat

Fake the uptime file:

```bash

Fake the version file:

```bash

Fake the vmstat file:

```

Then add mounting options in the proot startup script:

Structure: -b file_path:/proc/file_name

Example: -b /data/data/com.termux/stat:/proc/stat

For systems created with Guoguang's script:

```bash
sed -i '15a command+=" -b /data/data/com.termux/uptime:/proc/uptime"\ncommand+=" -b /data/data/com.termux/vmstat:/proc/vmstat"\ncommand+=" -b /data/data/com.termux/version:/proc/version"\ncommand+=" -b /data/data/com.termux/stat:/proc/stat"\ncommand+=" -b /data/data/com.termux/loadavg:/proc/loadavg"' ~/Termux-Linux/Ubuntu/start-ubuntu.sh
```

Now we've fixed the five files under the /proc partition. Let's enter the system to verify:

Enter 'cd' to go to the default directory, then enter:

```bash
cd ~/Termux-Linux/Ubuntu
./start-ubuntu.sh
```

After successful startup, enter 'ps'. There should be no errors. Or to be more rigorous, enter:

```bash
ps -ef
```

If you see files arranged vertically in rows, it's successful.

Next, let's start installing the BT Panel. First, install tools:

```bash
yes | apt install git iproute2 locales vim
```

After installation, deploy the BT acceleration package:

```bash
git clone https://gitclone.com/github.com/NothingMeaning/pdusb-fast-btpanel
```

This might take some time. After installation, enter:

```bash
./pdusb-fast-btpanel/pdbolt-inst-bt-acel.sh
```

If everything is fine so far, let's start the official installation of the BT Panel:

```bash
bash /tmp/btp/pdbolt-bt-install/install.sh
```

We'll see the familiar BT installation page. Enter 'y' and press Enter, then wait for a while...

After installation, there will be errors. The first is a permission error. Enter:

```bash
chmod -R +x /www
```

If there's an error after entering this command, delete the spaces and add them back yourself. It will wait for a few seconds. If nothing is displayed, it means the permission was granted successfully.

Next, fix the other error: missing en_US.UTF-8 locale:

```bash
sh: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (en_US.UTF-8)
```

Enter 158, then enter 3, and the installation is complete. You can start using BT Panel. Enter the BT startup command 'bt' to see the command-line panel. Enter:

```bash
bt 14
```

to see the panel address.

### Advice

This tutorial is suitable for those who are hands-on and love tinkering. After installing BT Panel, you'll encounter many issues in the panel. BT is designed for servers, and many software adaptations are difficult for Android. Of course, those with strong hands-on abilities should be able to solve these issues.
