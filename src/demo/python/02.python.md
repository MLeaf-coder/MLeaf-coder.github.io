#### 1. Recommended Python Editors

- **[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)**:  
  PyCharm is a powerful IDE particularly suited for large projects. It offers excellent debugging tools, code suggestions, version control integration, and a rich plugin ecosystem. While it may have a steeper learning curve, it's a solid choice for in-depth project development.

- **[Visual Studio Code](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)**:  
  VS Code is a lightweight code editor that is widely popular for its speed and flexibility. It supports multiple programming languages and plugins, making it ideal for quick development and simple projects. Many developers appreciate its Git integration, which is quite convenient.

- **[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)**:  
  Jupyter Notebook is a popular choice in data science and machine learning, particularly for interactive programming. It allows code to be run in chunks, making it suitable for data analysis and visualization, enabling immediate feedback. For workflows that require data visualization and report generation, Jupyter is a very practical tool.

#### 2. Common Shortcuts in Editors

- **Ctrl + S**: Save the file
- **Ctrl + Z**: Undo
- **Ctrl + Y**: Redo
- **Ctrl + C**: Copy
- **Ctrl + V**: Paste
- **Ctrl + F**: Find
- **Ctrl + /**: Comment/Uncomment the selected line
- **Shift + F10**: Run the current script

Familiarizing yourself with these shortcuts can greatly enhance your coding efficiency, so it's recommended to incorporate them into your daily routine.

#### 3. Meaning of Comments and Other Symbols

- **#**: Single-line comment; Python ignores the content of that line.  
  Using comments helps yourself and other developers understand the logic of your code, so it's advisable to maintain good commenting practices.

  ```python
  # This is a comment
  print("Hello, World!")  # Outputs "Hello, World!"
  ```

- **''' ''' or """ """**: Multi-line comment, suitable for explaining blocks of code.  
  For complex logic or sections that require detailed explanation, multi-line comments can clearly convey intent.

  ```python
  """
  This is a multi-line comment
  Can be used to explain complex logic
  """
  ```

- **Variable Assignment**: `=` assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.  
  Understanding the use of variables is crucial for writing effective code.

  ```python
  x = 10  # Assigns 10 to the variable x
  ```

- **Operators**:
  - `+`: Addition
  - `-`: Subtraction
  - `*`: Multiplication
  - `/`: Division
  - `//`: Floor Division
  - `%`: Modulus
  - `**`: Exponentiation

Mastering these operators will significantly improve your programming skills.
